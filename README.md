## How its Made:

**Tech used:** Cordova, HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Why was this stack chosen?

Cordova provides the possibility to build apps for Android / iOS platforms with the HTML/CSS/JavaScript stack, removing the need to use native languages such as Java, and Kotlin... It also provides robust & easy to use plugins that make the development process fairly straightforward. This app utilizes the Cordova [camera plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/reference/cordova-plugin-camera/index.html). The user is greeted with a page that shows a button; when pressed, it launches the camera application and takes a pic, this image is stored in the device's local storage.
This app currently has no back end and the picture resides only on the user's device.

## Lessons Learned:

Learnt the use of [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) & the Cordova [camera plugin](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/reference/cordova-plugin-camera/index.html). Installed [Node](https://nodejs.org/), 
[Java sdk](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11), 
[Gradle](https://gradle.org/) & [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclsrc=ds&gclsrc=ds) 

Cordova makes building and deploying Android/iOS apps very easy for the JavaScript Engineer.
